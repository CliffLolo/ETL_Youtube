# ETL With Youtube Data
## Project Overview 
This script scrapes data from [Youtube](https://youtube.com/en). Results are saved into a csv file for further analysis.

*Tools used:*
- **jupyter noteboook**
- **Python 3.7**
- **google account**
- **pandas**

## Task

Write a script that extracts YouTube data to analyze the #endsars# trend that rocked the entire world.
The script should be able to perform the following:

* Filter out channels and playlists.
* Get only videos published this year.
* Include videos that are between 4 to 20 mins long.
* Generic such that the search query can be changed.

### Output

Store the output into a csv with the filename having the following format: current_timestamp_youtube_data.

The following video attributes should be a part of the dataset:

* the time video was published
* the video id
* the title of the video
* description
* the URL of the video thumbnail
* number of views
* number of likes
* number of dislikes
* number of comments

Create an additional the column that builds the video URL using the video id.
